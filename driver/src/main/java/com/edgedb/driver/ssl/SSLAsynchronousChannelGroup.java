/**
 * A grouping of ssl asynchronous channels for the purpose of resource sharing.
 *
 * <p> A ssl asynchronous channel group encapsulates the mechanics required to
 * handle the completion of I/O operations initiated by {@link com.edgedb.driver.ssl.SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel
 * channels} that are bound to the group. A group has an associated
 * single-threaded executor service to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to
 * {@link java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler completion-handlers} that consume the result of
 * asynchronous operations performed on channels in the group.
 *
 * <p> An ssl asynchronous channel group is created by invoking one of its constructors.
 * SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel channels are bound to a group by
 * specifying the group when opening the channel. The associated executor service is <em>owned</em>
 * by the group; termination of the group results in the
 * shutdown of the associated executor service.
 *
 * <p> The completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a
 * SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel channel bound to a group is guaranteed to be invoked by
 * its associated thread. This ensures that the completion handler is run by the thread with the
 * expected <em>identity</em>.
 *
 * <p> Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread
 * is the pooled thread in the group then the completion handler may
 * be invoked directly by the initiating thread.
 * <p>
 * <a id="shutdown"></a><b>Shutdown and Termination</b>
 *
 * <p> The {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method is used to initiate an <em>orderly
 * shutdown</em> of a group. An orderly shutdown marks the group as shutdown;
 * further attempts to construct a channel that binds to the group will throw
 * {@link java.nio.channels.ShutdownChannelGroupException}. Whether or not a group is shutdown can
 * be tested using the {@link #isShutdown() isShutdown} method. Once shutdown,
 * the group <em>terminates</em> when all asynchronous channels that are bound to
 * the group are closed, all actively executing completion handlers have run to
 * completion. No attempt is made to stop executing completion handlers. The
 * {@link #isTerminated() isTerminated} method is used to test if the group has
 * terminated, and the {@link #awaitTermination awaitTermination} method can be
 * used to block until the group has terminated.
 *
 * <p> The {@link #shutdownNow() shutdownNow} method can be used to initiate a
 * <em>forceful shutdown</em> of the group. In addition to the actions performed
 * by an orderly shutdown, the {@code shutdownNow} method closes all open channels
 * in the group.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Note</b>
 * <p>An SSLAsynchronousChannelGroup object is essentially a wrapper of an
 * {@link AsynchronousChannelGroup} group. The reasons, why class {@link SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel}
 * does not use {@link AsynchronousChannelGroup} directly, are:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel needs a group with a single-threaded executor service. This is
 *      constructed in the SSLAsynchronousChannelGroup constructor.</li>
 *  <li>SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel class needs to access the executor service to that the group is
 *      bound. However, class AsynchronousChannelGroup does not offer a method to access the underlying
 *      executor service.</li>
 * </ol>
