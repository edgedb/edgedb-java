/**
 * The {@code SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel} class represents an asynchronous socket
 * channel that supports encrypting and decrypting of data according to the SSL/TLS
 * protocol. Moreover, it can be configured, if the connection uses the SSL/TLS protocol 
 * or transfers data as plaintext. Hence, the same interface can be used for SSL and
 * non-SSL connections.
 * <p>
 * The channel is a duplex channel, i.e. it is possible to write to and read
 * from the channel at the same time.
 * <p>
 * In Java 7 the {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} class was implemented. It simplifies
 * usage of the {@code SocketChannel} class in a classical selector pattern by introducing
 * callback handlers for connect, write and read events. However, the
 * {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} class supports only plaintext data transfer. Hence, if
 * an application needs to send or receive data via the SSL/TLS protocol, the application
 * itself needs to care for SSL/TLS handshaking and ciphering and deciphering of the
 * data. This limits the applicability of the {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} class.
 * <p>
 * The {@code SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel} class extends by composition the
 * {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} class by adding a layer for SSL/TLS. This layer
 * is responsible for handshaking and for encrypting and decrypting plaintext data. These
 * procedures are transparent to the user. It supports all versions of the SSL/TLS protocol,
 * including TLS 1.3.
 * <p>The public methods and the semantics of class
 * {@code SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel} follow that of class
 * {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel}. There are two factory methods for opening the channel:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *    SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel channel = SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel.open(group);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * In this case, SSL/TLS protocol is chosen automatically, if the port used for
 * connecting the channel to its peer is 443. Otherwise, the SSL/TLS protocol is not in
 * use. By setting the boolean parameter {@code useSSL} accordingly, the following overloaded
 * version of the method
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel channel = SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel.open(group, useSSL);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * lets the user specify explicitly, if the SSL/TLS protocol should be used or not. After the channel is opend, a
 * connection to the peer will be established by invoking
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   channel.connect(address, attachement, connectHandler);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * The command
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   channel.write(src, timeout, timeUnit, attachement, writeHandler);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * writes data asynchronously to the channel. If the connection uses the SSL/TLS protocol,
 * the data are enchrypted before they are written into the physical socket. Asynchronous
 * reading of data sent by the peer is triggered by
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   channel.read(dst, timeout, timeUnit, attachement, readHandler);
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * If SSL/TLS is in use, the data will be decrypted before they are written into the
 * destination {@code dst}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note on the shutdown process:</b> TLS 1.2 and earlier versions of TLS use a duplex-close policy, i.e.
 * if one of the peers closes its write direction, the other peer will send a close_notify alert
 * and will close its write direction, too. In contrast, TLS 1.3 uses a half-close policy, i.e.
 * if one of the peers closes its write direction, the other peer is allowed let its write direction 
 * open and to continue sending data. The class {@code SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel} uses the 
 * duplex-close policy. This concerns two cases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If a close_notify alert is received from a peer, an instance of {@code SSLAsynchronousSocketChannel}
 * will reply a close_notify alert and will close the connection.</li>
 * <li>The {@code shutdown()} methods will send a close_notify alert to the peer and will duplex-close the channel
 * after the alert was received by the peer.</li>
 * </ol>

/*
 * ** Documentation of the exception handling **
 *
 * There are 2 types of interaction where an exception could be thrown:
 *
 *   1. call of a public method
 *
 *   2. processing of a background task. There, the following methods can be executed:
 *      a) connectHandler.completed / connectHandler.failed
 *      b) writeHandler.completed   / writeHandler.failed
 *      c) readHandler.completed    / readHandler.failed
 *      d) doTask
 *      e) the task coming from handshake()
 *
 * Exceptions are treated accordingly:
 *
 *   Case 1:   The exception is thrown (so the user can react)
 *
 *   Case 2:  - There are no critical actions in the failed methods; no exceptions should be thrown there. The failed methods call doNotOK. *
 *            - The completed methods all have a surrounding try-catch-block. In the catch-block doNotOK is called.
 *            - The methods writeHandler.completed, readHandler.completed also have a finally block where defered write/read commands
 *              are executed. The invoked methods processDeferedWriteTask and processDeferedReadTask perform their actions within a
 *              try-catch-block and the catch-block calls doNotOK.
 *            - If in doTask the delegated tasks are executed in their own tasks, the action takes place within a try-catch-block
 *              and the catch-block calls doNotOK. After the last one of the delegated tasks has terminated, a task is stated
 *              that invokes and examines the automat. This also happens in a try-catch-block where the catch-block calls doNotOK.
 *            - In the task submitted in handshake(), the action takes place in a try-catch-block and the catch-block calls doNotOK.
 *
 *   Summary: All possible actions are surrounded by a try-catch-block and the catch-block calls doNotOK.
 *
 * The central method doNotOK does:
 *
 *   1. If an exception was thrown at an action that has associated a user handler (i.e. the context's action is CONNECT,
 *      WRITE or READ), the failed method of the corresponding user handler is invoked.
 *
 *   2. If there is no associated user handler (i.e. the context's action is HANDSHAKE), then the channel is closed.
